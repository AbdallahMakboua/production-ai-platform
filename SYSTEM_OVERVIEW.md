## 💡 Three Success Principles

### 1. Follow the Plan Exactly
Don't improvise. Don't skip. Don't change. Just follow the plan.

### 2. Test Everything First (or Immediately After)
Before commit → must pass all tests.

### 3. Document Daily at EOD
Use Template from DOCUMENTATION_HELP_PROMPTS → I format your log.
